    <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Blake Kinnaman graduated with a Bachelors in IT Innovation from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in May 2023. 
            IT Innovation is a unique program that prepares students by exposing them to several facets of technology. 
            Specifically, the program focuses on project management, team building, and entreprenureship. 
            My favorite part of the IT Innovation program is that it allowed you to customize 1/3rd of your degree, 
            this amazing part of the degree that allows students to select your own classes is called  the 'area of emphasis,' 
            and it is the main reason he choose the program. One of Blake's greatest strenghts is in creativity, which is reflected 
            in the area of emphasis, choosen classes are detailed on the BS courses page.</p>
        <p>Blake has hopes of studying a masters in Environmetal Studies/Sciences. Quite the departure from the technology based program, Blake 
            wants to study about the environment and sustainability practices as the topic seems extremely relevant. He hopes to find a way 
            to blend the technology and entreprenuerial aspects of his bachelors program with the various aspects of environmentalism and sustainability.
            During and after the program, he hopes to use his newfound knowledge to help build a better future.</p>
        <p>Fun fact about Blake, when he was 27, he studied abroad in Lulea, Sweden for one year.</p>
